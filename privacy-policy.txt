Camera Color Picker for Devicebook Privacy Policy

1. Personal Information:
The app does not collect any personal information. It captures the color as
seen by your camera (HSV value) and sends it to Devicebook only if you are
using the Camera Color Picker in Devicebook.

2. How Camera is used:
The camera is only used for picking a color: the color is extracted as a
HSV value (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) from the pixels in the center.
